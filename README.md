# Active-Msg-Table
A routing and translation controller for IoT messages.

The aim of this project is to create a message routing and conversion controller that allows non-technical users to select message sources and types, apply a translation (e.g. from a continuous range to a limited number of steps) to the message and then select the destinations for the messages to be passed to.
To set these parameters an interactive routing and translation table will be used.
